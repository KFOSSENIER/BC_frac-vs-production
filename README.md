# BC_frac-vs-production
hydraulic frac input vs well productivity for montney wells in NE BC

This project relates hydraulic fracture inputs such as quantity of sand and water to the overall productivity of a well.  One key element missing is reservoir quality which is neither in a publicly available dataset or easy to acquire from horizontal wells information.  This project does highlight the varying importance of fracture inputs and could be used to direct the focus on those inputs with biggest impact.  This project should only be used as a guide/template for a more detailed well productivity analysis, and should include some reservoir quality input(s).
